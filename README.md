# Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis is creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

Datasets containing ride and city data were used to calculate metrics such as total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver for each of the respective city types.The Data sets were also used to create a new data frame to find the average fare per week from January 1st 2019 to April 29th 2019 for each of the city types. The dataframe from the analysis was used to create a multiple-line graph that visualized the total weekly fares for each city type for the before mentioned period. 

# Results

### Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city type.

# Summary

## Observations from ride share metrics from Janury to enf of April of 2019

* Urban cities have the most amount of rides and drivers and rural cities have the least.
* **Urban brings the most revenue** as we can see in the Total Fares column and **rural cities bring the least amount of revenue**.
* Rural city types have the highest average fare per ride while urban cities have the lowest.
* Average fare per driver, from this data it can be seen that drivers in the rural city type make $55.49 per ride, whereas the drivers in urban areas make almost 3 times less per ride which is $16.57.
* The 3rd week of February has the highest total fares for each of the city type showing increased demand at that time. Urban cities aslo seem to bring a lot of revenue in the first and third week of March. Towards the start of January 2019 and towards the end of April all Fares for each city type are showling decline.

## Statement directed to the CEO
### Business recommendations regarding disparities among the city types:
1. As the average ride fare in rural cities is higher than the ones in urban cities that means that there's a chance of getting more revenue in rural ares if the number of drivers are increased in urban settings.
2. The fact that in average a driver in a rural city make three times more than in urban cities can be used as incentive to attract more drivers in rural cities.
3. The suburban city type is the middle performing city type in all the metrics calculated, therefore more investments can be directed towards Urban and Rural city types.
